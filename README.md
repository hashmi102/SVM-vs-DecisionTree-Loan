# Loan Approval Prediction

This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information like applicant income, education level, credit history, and more.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Algorithms Applied

- **Support Vector Machine (SVC)** — Best performing model (85% accuracy)
- **Decision Tree Classifier** — Achieved 75% accuracy

## 📊 Visualizations

- Count plot for loan approval status
- Histogram of applicant income
- Heatmap for feature correlation

## 📁 Files

- `loan_data.csv`: The dataset
- `loan_approval.ipynb`: Code file with model training
- `README.md`: This file

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `loan_approval.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells step by step
